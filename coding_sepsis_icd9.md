#### SIRS
Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) is defined as a clinical response to an insult, infection, or trauma that includes a systemic inflammation as well as elevated or reduced temperature, rapid heart rate, rapid respiration, and elevated white blood count. According to the American College of Chest Physicians and the Society of Critical Care Medicine, the clinical manifestations of SIRS include:

  * Fever of greater than 100.4 or hypothermia with a temperature of less than 98.6
  * Leukocytosis, white blood cell count of greater than 12,000 cells per cubic millimeter
  * Leukopenia, white blood cell count of less than 4,000 cells per cubic millimeter
  * Tachycardia
  * Hyperventilation
  
Coding for SIRS requires a minimum of two codes: a code for the underlying cause or infection (such as trauma) and a code from subcategory 995.9x, Systemic inflammatory response syndrome.

#### SEPSIS
Sepsis is defined as SIRS due to an infection. The inclusion term sepsis was added to code 995.91, SIRS due to infectious process without organ dysfunction. Although sepsis and septicemia may be used interchangeably by the provider, from a coding perspective they are not synonymous. Coders should query the physician for clarification when appropriate.

Coding sepsis requires a minimum of two codes: a code for the systemic infection (e.g., 038.xx) and the code 995.91, SIRS due to infectious process without organ dysfunction. If no causal organism is documented within the medical record, query the physician or assign code 038.9, Unspecified septicemia.

The sequencing of sepsis as a principal diagnosis relies heavily on provider documentation. If sepsis is present on admission and meets the definition of principal diagnosis, the systemic infection code (038.xx, 112.5, etc.) should be sequenced first, followed by 995.91, SIRS due to infectious process without organ dysfunction. If sepsis develops during the hospital stay, both the systemic infection code and the 995.91 code should be sequenced as secondary diagnoses.
